Salutation Paul, Silas, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
The Thessalonians’ Faith and Example We give thanks to God always for you all, mentioning you in our prayers,
remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patient hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father.
For we know, beloved brothers, your election by God.
For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, just as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
You became followers of us and the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit.
Therefore you were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
For the word of the Lord sounded out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith in God has gone forth, so that we do not need to say anything.
For they themselves declare how we were received by you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.
