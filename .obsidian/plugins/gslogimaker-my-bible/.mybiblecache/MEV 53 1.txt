Salutation Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
The Judgment at Christ’s Coming We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you abounds toward each other.
So we boast about you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you are enduring.
This is evidence that God’s judgment, being righteous, will count you worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are suffering.
It is a righteous matter with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you,
and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels,
in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
They shall be punished with eternal destruction, isolated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at by all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.
Therefore we always pray for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and with power fulfill all your good desires and works done by faith,
so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
