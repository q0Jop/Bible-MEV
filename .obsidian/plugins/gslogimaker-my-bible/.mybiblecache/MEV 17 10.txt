Mordecaiâ€™s Greatness Then King Ahasuerus charged a tribute on the land and on the coastal lands of the sea.
All the deeds of his power and of his might, and the detailed record of the greatness of Mordecai, after the king promoted him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
