Job Replies: God’s Majesty Is Unsearchable But Job answered:
“How have you helped him who is without power? How have you saved the arm that has no strength?
How have you counseled him who has no wisdom? And how have you plentifully declared sound knowledge?
To whom have you uttered words? And whose breath came from you?
“The departed spirits tremble under the waters, and their inhabitants.
The underworld is naked before Him, and destruction has no covering.
He stretches out the north over empty space, He hangs the earth upon nothing.
He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them.
He covers the face of the full moon and spreads His cloud over it.
He has circled the waters with boundaries, until the day and night come to an end.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His reproof.
He divides the sea with His power, and by His understanding He strikes through the proud.
By His breath He has made fair the heavens; His hand has formed the fleeing serpent.
Indeed, these are but a part of His ways, and how small a whisper we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand?”
