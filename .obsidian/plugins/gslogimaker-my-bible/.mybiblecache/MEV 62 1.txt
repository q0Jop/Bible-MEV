The Word of Life That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life—
the life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and announce to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us—
we declare to you that which we have seen and heard, that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
We are writing these things to you so that our joy may be complete.
God Is Light This then is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have fellowship with Him, yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.
